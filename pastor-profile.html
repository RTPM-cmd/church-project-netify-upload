Even though this child grew up surrounded by idol worshippers, he knew there existed a greater power above. From his childhood days Pastor Abraham G. Sarnie vision was to be a Soldier of man not knowing the call of YAHWEH upon his life was to be a soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ as you can see today. 
                    
                    He became married in December 16, 2006 to his loving wife Mother Angelina Sarnie and presently they are blessed with 6 Children Abraham, Archie, Archel, Success, Tehillah and Angie.

                <h3>The establishment and Achievements of the Church</h3>
                <img src="./img/church1.jpg" alt="profile" class="img-responsive add-border-hover" />
                <p>
                    Pastor Sarnie and his wife Mrs. Sarnie launched the vision of the church on August 30, 2008 at the YES Building on camp Johnson Road, Liberia with 15 persons in the first service. The Redeeming Time Pilgrims Ministries is an extension of the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ in 1 Corinthians 3:11.

                    According to the Overseer, Pastor Abraham G. Sarnie, this ministry was established in order to bring back children of God who are lost in dead Churches and to prepare them for the soon coming King Jesus Christ. 
                    At the end of 2008, Mr & Mrs  Quaway Johnson, Mr & Mrs Justin Jallah, Min. James O. Jallah, Mother. Marien Kamoika, Mrs. Caroline A. Caroll and Father. Marvee Wealleh came on board to bring this vision to pass. Later, this ministry was relocated at the Monrovia Demonstration School on January 4, 2009. Liberia.

                    Since its meeting, within the period of 12 years has been striving to build a decent place of worship with the little resources as you can see. The church was blessed with the Headquarter land we are presently occupying in Centre Monrovia through the help of the Jallahâ€™s family for the good things the Lord has been doing for them through this ministry. Today we can thank God for His supernatural speed He has given us and for those outside of this ministry who continue to be a blessing. Since its Gathering of the Saints, the R.T.P.M. has launched 4 branches.
