                <p>
                    The Redeeming Time Pilgrims Ministries (RTPM) also known as the (REPENTANCE HOUSE) is a vision the Lord God Almighty and 
                    since its meeting, within the period of 12 years has been striving to build a decent place of worship with the little resources as you can see. The church was blessed with the Headquarter land we are presently occupying in Centre Monrovia through the help of the Jallah’s family for the good things the Lord has been doing for them through this ministry. Today we can thank God for His supernatural speed He has given us and for those outside of this ministry who continue to be a blessing. Since its Gathering of the Saints, the R.T.P.M. has launched 4 branches.

                    RTPM is a do-it-yourself Gospel ministry where your hands are trained to wage war and your fingers to do battle. RTPM is a full gospel ministry devoted to the Revival of Apostolic Signs, Holy Ghost fireworks and the unlimited demonstration of the power of God to deliver to the uttermost.

                    Today, God is still doing marvelous deeds through Redeeming Time Pilgrims Ministries in Liberia. One of the well-known programs of the Church is the Holy Ghost Intervention Hour that takes place the first Saturday in every month.

                    A church choir’s job is not just to sing beautifully to unto the Lord, but rather it is to minister to the congregation and to each other in a variety of ways, helping to change the world into a more loving and peaceful place onto God Almighty.

                    Today, the singing ministry is found to have deviated from the earlier scriptural assignment. The aura of God seems to have departed from the divine worship of the Most High God. This column seeks to bring back the lost glory. For today, let us consider the meaning, position and purpose of Church Choir.

                   The word ‘Choir’ has several definitions. In general sense, it is simply a group or company of persons trained to sing together. It may be sacred or secular; mixed or made up of males or females alone. It could also be junior or adult choir.

                   Architecturally, a choir is that part of a church building appropriated or set aside for singers – chancel. Ecclesiastically, a choir is a group or company of Christian singers representing the Angelic Choir. The concern of this paper is Christian Singers. One who sings in the choir is a chorister.

                   Choristers are ministers of the gospel through songs. Choristers are the Levites of today, meant to perform sacred duties in the house of God (Numbers 3:6-12). Levites were members of a priestly tribe associated with the priesthood – they sang in the holy sanctuary and played different musical instruments. Numbers 3: 12b reads ‘…

                   Therefore, the Levites shall be mine’. Choristers are specially called by God to show forth His praise in no small measure. A true Levite of today is not a pretender, but a true child of God. Christ is the Head of the Church. The Church is the Body of Christ, while the Choir is (in this context) the NECK – linking the BODY to God. The Choir ministers directly to God, while the Preacher ministers to the congregation.
                   The duties of present day Levites (choristers, instrumental musicians) are sacred.
